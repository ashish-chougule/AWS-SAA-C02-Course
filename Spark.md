Types of Joins 

# Left-Semi-Join

Semi-Join can feel similar to Inner Join but the difference between them is that `Left Semi Join`only returns the records from the left-hand table, whereas the `Inner Join` returns the `columns` from both tables.

# Left-anti-Join

As the name suggests, it does exactly the opposite of Left semi-join. The output would just `return the data` that `doesnâ€™t have a match` on the `right` side table. Only the columns on the left side table would be included in the result.
